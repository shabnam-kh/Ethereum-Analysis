# Ethereum-Analysis

## PART A. TIME ANALYSIS (20%)
Create a bar plot showing the number of transactions occurring every month between the start and end of the dataset. Create a bar plot showing the average value of transactions in each month between the start and end of the dataset. Note: As the dataset spans multiple years and you are aggregating together all transactions in the same month, make sure to include the year in your analysis.
Note: Once the raw results have been processed within Hadoop/Spark you may create your bar plot in any software of your choice (excel, python, R, etc.)

## PART B. TOP TEN MOST POPULAR SERVICES (25%)
Evaluate the top 10 smart contracts by total Ether received. An outline of the subtasks required to extract this information is provided below, focusing on a MRJob based approach. This is, however, is not the only way to complete the task, as there are several other viable ways of completing this assignment.

JOB 1 - INITIAL AGGREGATION
To workout which services are the most popular, you will first have to aggregate transactions to see how much each address within the user space has been involved in. You will want to aggregate value for addresses in the to_address field. This, in essense, will be similar to the wordcount problem that we saw in Lab 1 and Lab 2.

JOB 2 - JOINING TRANSACTIONS/CONTRACTS AND FILTERING
Once you have obtained this aggregate of the transactions, the next step is to perform a repartition join between this aggregate and contracts (example here and slides here). You will want to join the to_address field from the output of Job 1 with the address field of contracts .

Secondly, in the reducer, if the address for a given aggregate from Job 1 was not present within contracts this should be filtered out as it is a user address and not a smart contract.

JOB 3 - TOP TEN
Finally, the third job will take as input the now filtered address aggregates and sort these via a top ten reducer, utilizing what you have learned from lab 4.

## PART C. TOP TEN MOST ACTIVE MINERS (15%)
Evaluate the top 10 miners by the size of the blocks mined. This is simpler as it does not require a join. You will first have to aggregate blocks to see how much each miner has been involved in. You will want to aggregate size for addresses in the miner field. This will be similar to the wordcount that we saw in Lab 1 and Lab 2. You can add each value from the reducer to a list and then sort the list to obtain the most active miners.

## PART D. DATA EXPLORATION (40+%)
The final part of the coursework requires you to explore the data and perform some (or all) analysis of your choosing. These tasks may be completed in either MRJob or Spark or any other relevant library/framework that you deem fit. Below are some suggested ideas for analysis that could be undertaken, along with an expected grade for completing it to a good standard. You may attempt several (or all) of these tasks.

SCAM ANALYSIS
Popular Scams: Utilising the provided scam dataset, what is the most lucrative form of scam? Does this correlate with certainly known scams going offline/inactive? For the correlation, you could produce the count of how many scams for each category are active/inactive/offline/online/etc and try to correlate it with volume (value) to make conclusions on whether state plays a factor in making some scams more lucrative. Therefore, getting the volume and state of each scam, you can make a conclusion whether the most lucrative ones are ones that are online or offline or active or inactive. So for that purpose, you need to just produce a table with SCAM TYPE, STATE, VOLUME which would be enough (15%).
Wash Trading: Wash trading is defined as "Entering into or purporting to enter into, transactions to give the appearance that purchases and sales have been made, without incurring market risk or changing the traderâ€™s market position" Unregulated exchanges use these to fake up to 70% of their trading volume? Which addresses are involved in wash trading? Which trader has the highest volume of wash trades? How certain are you of your result? More information can be found at https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442381.3449824. One way to measure ether balance over time is also possible but you will need to discuss accuracy concerns. (20%)
CONTRACT TYPES
Identifying Contract Types The identification and classification of smart contracts can help us to better understand the behavior of smart contracts and figure out vulnerabilities, such as confirming fraud contracts. By identifying features of different contracts such as number of transactions, number of uniques outflow addresses, Ether balance, and others we can identify different types of contracts. How many different types can you identify? What is the most popular type of contract? More information can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457320309547#bib0019. Please note that you are not required to use the types defined in this paper. Partial marks will be awarded for feature extraction and analysis. (20%)
MISCELLANEOUS ANALYSIS
Fork the Chain: There have been several forks of Ethereum in the past. Identify one or more of these and see what effect it had on price and general usage. For example, did a price surge/plummet occur, and who profited most from this? (10%)

Gas Guzzlers: For any transaction on Ethereum a user must supply gas. How has gas price changed over time? Have contracts become more complicated, requiring more gas, or less so? Also, could you correlate the complexity for some of the top-10 contracts found in Part-B by observing the change over their transactions (10%)

Comparative Evaluation Reimplement Part B in Spark (if your original was MRJob, or vice versa). How does it run in comparison? Keep in mind that to get representative results you will have to run the job multiple times, and report median/average results. Can you explain the reason for these results? What framework seems more appropriate for this task? (10%)
